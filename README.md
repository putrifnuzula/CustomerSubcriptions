Explored the given dataset, imputing the missing values based on the skewness of the data.
Built two models: one with all the features and the other with the 10 most important features. The second model perfomed better with 90% accuracy and was deployed using FastAPI to provide recommendations to business decision-makers.

Notes: While working on this project, I also discovered a data imbalance that I had overlooked, which can be addressed by trying oversampling or SMOTE methods.
